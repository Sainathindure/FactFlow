The project is focused on classifying news prompts as either fake or legitimate. We utilized a Naive Bayes classifier coupled with the NLTK toolkit, harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) to tackle misinformation head-on.

This project underscores our commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit, particularly in the realm of media literacy and combating fake news. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm immensely grateful to our team for their hard work and dedication.
